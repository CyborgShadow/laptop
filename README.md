Laptop
======
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/monfresh/laptop.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/monfresh/laptop)

Laptop is a script to set up an OS X computer for web development.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely. It installs,
upgrades, or skips packages based on what is already installed on the machine.

This particular version of the script is geared toward beginners who want to
set up a Ruby on Rails environment on their Mac. More advanced users can
easily [customize](#customize-in-laptoplocal) the script to install additional
tools. To see an example of a more advanced script, check out
[18F/laptop](https://github.com/18F/laptop).

Requirements
------------

I support clean installations of these operating systems:

* [macOS Sierra](https://www.apple.com/macos/sierra/) (10.12)
* OS X El Capitan (10.11)
* OS X Yosemite (10.10)
* OS X Mavericks (10.9)

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested. Bug reports for older
versions are welcome.

Install
-------

Begin by opening the Terminal application on your Mac. The easiest way to open
an application in OS X is to search for it via [Spotlight]. The default
keyboard shortcut for invoking Spotlight is `command-Space`. Once Spotlight
is up, just start typing the first few letters of the app you are looking for,
and once it appears, press `return` to launch it.

In your Terminal window, copy and paste each of these three commands one at a
time, then press `return` after each one. The first two commands download the
files the script needs to run, and the third command executes the script.

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monfresh/laptop/master/mac
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monfresh/laptop/master/Brewfile
bash mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log && source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
```

The [script](https://github.com/monfresh/laptop/blob/master/mac) itself is
available in this repo for you to review if you want to see what it does
and how it works.

Note that the script will ask you to enter your OS X password at various
points. This is the same password that you use to log in to your Mac.
If you don't already have it installed, GitHub for Mac will launch
automatically at the end of the script so you can set up everything you'll
need to push code to GitHub.

**Once the script is done, quit and relaunch Terminal.**

Debugging
---------

Your last Laptop run will be saved to a file called `laptop.log` in your home
folder. Read through it to see if you can debug the issue yourself. If not,
copy the entire contents of `laptop.log` into a
[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/monfresh/laptop/issues/new) for me.
Or, attach the whole log file as an attachment.

What it sets up
---------------

* [Bundler] for managing Ruby gems
* [chruby] for managing [Ruby] versions
* [Flux] for adjusting your Mac's display color so you can sleep better
* [GitHub Desktop] for setting up your SSH keys automatically
* [Heroku Toolbelt] for deploying and managing Heroku apps
* [Homebrew] for managing operating system libraries
* [Homebrew Cask] for quickly installing Mac apps from the command line
* [Homebrew Services] so you can easily stop, start, and restart services
* [hub] for interacting with the GitHub API
* [PhantomJS] for headless website testing
* [Postgres] for storing relational data
* [ruby-install] for installing different versions of Ruby
* [Sublime Text 3] for coding all the things
* [Zsh] as your shell

[Bundler]: http://bundler.io/
[chruby]: https://github.com/postmodern/chruby
[Flux]: https://justgetflux.com/
[GitHub Desktop]: https://desktop.github.com/
[Heroku Toolbelt]: https://toolbelt.heroku.com/
[Homebrew]: http://brew.sh/
[Homebrew Cask]: http://caskroom.io/
[Homebrew Services]: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-services
[hub]: https://github.com/github/hub
[PhantomJS]: http://phantomjs.org/
[Postgres]: http://www.postgresql.org/
[Ruby]: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/
[ruby-install]: https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install
[Sublime Text 3]: http://www.sublimetext.com/3
[Zsh]: http://www.zsh.org/

It should take less than 15 minutes to install (depends on your machine and
internet connection).

The script also lightly customizes your Zsh prompt so that it displays your
current directory in orange, followed by the current Ruby version or gemset in
green, and sets the prompt character to `$`. It also allows you to easily
distinguish directories from files when running `ls` by displaying directories
in a different color. Below is a screenshot showing what the colors look like
when using the default Terminal white background, the Solarized Dark theme, and the Solarized Light theme.

![Terminal screenshots](http://cl.ly/image/19022S0q3H1b/download/Image%202015-05-12%20at%2011.31.04%20PM.png)

If you want to use the [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)
themes, run the following commands in your Terminal:
```bash
cd ~

curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomislav/osx-terminal.app-colors-solarized/master/Solarized%20Dark.terminal

curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomislav/osx-terminal.app-colors-solarized/master/Solarized%20Light.terminal

open Solarized%20Dark.terminal

open Solarized%20Light.terminal
```

This will add the Solarized themes to your Terminal's Profiles, and if you want to set one of them as the default, go to your Terminal's Preferences,
click on the Settings tab, scroll down to the Solarized Profile, click on it,
then click the Default button. When you open a new window or tab (or if you quit and relaunch Terminal), it will use the Solarized theme.

If you want to try out different prompt colors other than orange and green,
open your `.zshrc` in Sublime Text:

```sh
subl ~/.zshrc
```

Then in the line that starts with `precmd`, replace `{166}` and `{65}` with
any of the 256 possible [Xterm colors](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Xterm_color_chart.png).
Save the file, then open a new Terminal window or tab to see the changes.


Customize in `~/.laptop.local` and `Brewfile`
---------------------------------------------
```sh
# Go to your OS X user's root directory
cd ~

# Download the sample file to your computer
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monfresh/laptop/master/.laptop.local

# open the file in Sublime Text
subl .laptop.local
```

Your `~/.laptop.local` is run at the end of the `mac` script.
Put your customizations there. You can use the `.laptop.local` you downloaded
above to get started. It lets you install the following tools:

* [Atom] - GitHub's open source text editor
* [CloudApp] for sharing screenshots and making an animated GIF from a video
* [Firefox] for testing your Rails app on a browser other than Chrome or Safari
* [iTerm2] - an awesome replacement for the OS X Terminal

[Atom]: https://atom.io/
[CloudApp]: http://getcloudapp.com/
[Firefox]: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/
[iTerm2]: http://iterm2.com/

Write your customizations such that they can be run safely more than once.
See the `mac` script for examples.

Laptop functions such as `fancy_echo`, and `gem_install_or_update` can be used
in your `~/.laptop.local`.

Editing the `Brewfile`
----------------------
Most of what the script installs is listed in the `Brewfile`. If you don't want
the script to install certain tools, you can remove them from the `Brewfile`.

How to manage background services (such as Postgres)
----------------------------------------------------------
The script does not automatically launch these services after installation
because you might not need or want them to be running. With Homebrew Services,
starting, stopping, or restarting these services is as easy as:

```
brew services start|stop|restart [name of service]
```

For example:

```
brew services start postgresql
```

To see a list of all installed services:

```
brew services list
```

To start all services at once:

```
brew services start --all
```

How to switch your shell back to bash from zsh (or vice versa)
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. Find out which shell you're currently running: `echo $SHELL`
2. Find out the location of the shell you want to switch to. For example, if
   you want to switch to `bash`, run `which bash`.
3. Verify if the shell location is included in `/etc/shells`.
   Run `cat /etc/shells` to see the contents of the file.
4. If the location of the shell is included, run `chsh -s [the location of the shell]`.
   For example, if `which bash` returned `/bin/bash`, you would run `chsh -s /bin/bash`.

   If the location of the shell is not in `/etc/shells`, add it, then run the `chsh` command.
   If you have Sublime Text, you can open the file by running `subl /etc/shells`.
